    I started and finished this asgn today. My thought process went as follows:
        - Reference my old list ADT from cse101
        - Build queue ADT
        - Make it thread safe
    Took 6 hours including 2 hour power nap (useful)!

    Sad to see that there is only 3 tests given to use, really would have appreciated 
    more tests to be uploaded considering the asgn is due tomorrow.
